This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Description

This full-stack uses React, Node, Express, SQLite and Sequelize to create and manage courses.

## How do I use this App?

Download the files, then;

- Open a terminal at the api directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm seed` to initialize the database
- Run `npm start`
- This will start the Sequelize folder on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Open a terminal at the client directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- This will run the app on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## What can I do with this App?

Using the delightful purple interface, you can (and by "you" I mean authorized user accounts that you create) create courses, give them descriptions, include an estimated time of completion and allow the user to know what supplies they will need to complete the course.
